We're looking for a

# Kubernetes Software Engineer

## About us

**CLASTIX** is a young Italian technology startup that helps enterprises to adopt _Cloud Native_ solutions through an innovative set of products and services.

**CLASTIX** develops and integrates open source software projects for automated operations across cloud, edge, and data-centers. We support customers of any size to adopt modern infrastructures and embrace the Cloud Native revolution. We believe in continuous learning, flexibility, agile methodology, sharing ideas and knowledge, supporting each other, and pushing ourselves to the next level.

Open-source is part of our DNA. We are the maintainers of [Capsule](https://github.com/clastix/capsule), an open-source Operator for implementing multi-tenancy in Kubernetes. Our commercial product is _Clastix Enterprise Kubernetes_, a suite of integrated cloud native components, including _Capsule_, all wrapped together and made available as an enterprise ready platform and deployable as a single solution.

## What we are looking for

We are looking for a _remote experienced Kubernetes expert and Go engineer_ to join our team to build open-source developer tooling in the cloud-native space.

## What you will do

You will be a key part of a talented and successful engineering team that works together with important customers to build cutting-edge technology solutions based on our open source stack.

## You're required to:

- Build new features for our open-source projects and for our commercial products.
- Take responsibility for everything you are working on - from taking on an issue, over planning the implementation, writing the code, documenting it, adding the tests to actually ship the feature as part of our release workflow.
- Write Go code that is easy-to-test, performant, and well-structured.
- Drive really deep into the internals of Kubernetes: controllers, CRDs, extension API servers, etc.
- Contribute to docs and tests for all projects you are working on to ensure we ship high-quality code for our enterprise customers and open-source community users.

Optionally you’ll:

- Participate in CNCF events (e.g. KubeCon), share your work and/or be an active member of the open-source ecosystem

## Requirements

- Intense hands-on experience with Kubernetes and containers in general
- Extensive experience with Go
- Deep conceptual and architectural understanding of microservices, containers, complex distributed systems, and systems at scale
- Solid hands-on experience with bash, containers, e2e testing, and CI/CD systems
- Extensive knowledge of the cloud-native ecosystem including CNCF projects, cloud-native developer tools, container build systems, and Kubernetes platforms
- Experience with at least one of the major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- A team player mindset with excellent written and verbal communications skills, that will help you and your colleagues to stay connected and keep everyone in the loop while being remote
- A passion for building developer tooling and automation that will drive you to constantly improve and extend our tool suite for the benefit of our users and customers
- No issues with communicating and contributing code publicly since we're largely an open-source company
- We require you'll be able to work in a multidisciplinary and cross-functional team. Good written and spoken proficiency in English is a must.

## Why join a startup?

- **Flexible Working Schedule**: You have a doctor’s appointment or need to head to the supermarket to get groceries at 2pm? We won’t have an issue with that. To us, results matter more than clocking in and out at the same time every day.
- **Remote**: if you want to work from home, that’s great! If you’d prefer to work in a coworking space, or in an exotic location, that’s fine as well.
- **Open-Minded Work Environment**: you can always speak your mind - no unnecessary formalities. We are operating in a lean, honest, and efficient way and we are looking for different perspectives, constructive feedback and creative, motivated people who want to make a difference.
- **Grow With The Company**: we are a small company right now but we are growing incredibly fast because we work on something that has a lot of value to engineering teams in large enterprises. Joining Clastix early will give you the chance to advance much faster to the next step on the career ladder than in any larger company.
- **Responsibility From Day 1**: you will see right from the start that your work will immediately have an impact in our company and you can shape the future of this company together with the rest of our team. Grow with us and benefit from being part of this journey from the start.


## Our offer

We offer a full-time job and multiple benefits: continuous internal training, performance-based bonuses, a cool laptop, and remote working.

Gross salary is expected between 40K-60K EUR/year, depending on the candidate's experience.

## Work location

Our offices are based in Milan, Italy, and The Hague, Netherlands. However, we will also evaluate candidates living everywhere in Europe who want to work remotely and are open to travel only when required.

## Recruiting process

You'll get a first screening interview to discuss your background, your habits, and your previous working experience, also in the open-source community.

Once done, a small practical task will be assigned to you: a GitHub repository with the user story is going to be privately shared and a Pull Request is expected within the agreed deadline.

At this phase, a code review will be performed to evaluate your soft skills: we strongly believe in the remote-first approach, so an asynchronous mode of interactions is mandatory, as well our core and ethical values.

If the Pull Request is approved, a final call to meet the team will be made and all the onboarding arrangements will be settled.

## How to apply

Sending an email with your CV attached to [jobs@clastix.io](mailto:jobs@clastix.io).

Please share your GitHub/BitBucket/GitLab profile with us, if you have one and you are contributing to open-source projects.

This announcement is addressed to all genders, according to Italian laws 903/77 and 125/91, and to all ages and nationalities, according to the Italian laws 215/03 and 216/03.
