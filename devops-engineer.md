  and data-centers.

  (~70% customer-facing).
- Collect suggestions and improvements coming from the Customer's feedback and
  requirements and thus help us to provide new products and better solutions.
- Being tech-savvy and a lifelong learner, stay updated on new technologies and

## Who you are

subjects:

  (_CSI_, _CNI_, _SMI_)

At **CLASTIX**, we understand that no one fits all, so we're open to supporting
you if you are available to learn. The following competencies would be
considered a highly valuable plus:
 
- GitOps practices
- Distributed Systems patterns
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Monitoring tools (Prometheus)
- Best practices and IT operations in High-Availability, Backup, and Disaster
  Recovery environments
- eBPF/XDP/TC
 
We require you'll be able to work in a multidisciplinary and cross-functional
team. Good written and spoken proficiency in **both** the **English** and the
**Italian** languages is a must.
 
## Our offer

We offer a full-time job and multiple benefits: continuous internal training,
performance-based bonus, a cool laptop (MacBook), and remote working.

Gross salary is expected between **40K-60K EUR/year**, depending on the
candidate's experience.
 
## Work location

Our offices are based in **Milan**, Italy, and **The Hague**, Netherlands.

However, we will also evaluate candidates living everywhere in **Europe** who
want to **work from remote** and are open to travel only when required.
 
# Recruiting process

You'll get a first screening interview to discuss your background, your habits,
and your previous working experience, also in the open-source community.

Once done, a small practical task will be assigned to you: a GitHub repository
with the user story is going to be privately shared and a Pull Request is
expected within the agreed deadline.

At this phase, a code review will be performed to evaluate your soft skills:
we strongly believe in the remote-first approach, so an asynchronous mode of
interactions is mandatory, as well our core and ethical values.

If the Pull Request will be approved, a final call will be made and all the
onboarding arrangements will be settled.
 
# How to apply

Sending an email with your CV attached to `jobs [at] clastix.io`.
 
Please share your GitHub/BitBucket/GitLab profile with us, if you have one and
you are contributing to open-source projects.
