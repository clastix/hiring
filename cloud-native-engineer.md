# Cloud Native Engineer

## About us

**CLASTIX** is a young Italian technology startup that helps enterprises to adopt _Cloud Native_ solutions through an innovative set of products and services.

We are the creators of [Capsule](https://capsule.clastix.io), a multi-tenant Operator aiming to solve the multi-tenancy dilemma in Kubernetes.
Besides that, we're directly involved with engaging customers that are looking to transform their digital transformation journey, embracing the Cloud Native revolution.

We believe in continuous learning, flexibility, agile methodology, sharing
ideas and knowledge, supporting each other and pushing ourselves to the next
level.
 
## What we are looking for

We're looking for an experienced engineer with a strong background in Software Development and execution on Kubernetes.
We strongly believe in Kubernetes as the de-facto standard for container orchestration, building scalable and resilient business-critical applications on top of it.
If distributed systems are your thing, Open-Source is part of your soul, and you're in love with hard challenges and collaborative working, this must be the place for you!

## What you will do

CLASTIX team is made of a talented and succesful engineering team, totally distributed and remote-work first based.
Our aim is to build cutting-edge technology solutions based on our open source stack.

You are required to:
 
- Design, build, and operate fully automated, highly scalable, efficient, and reliable customer software architectures based on Kubernetes and Cloud Services.
- Design, build and operate IaC (Infrastructures as a Code) across cloud, edge, and data-centers.
- Work with our Customers and bring a DevOps perspective into their teams (~70% customer-facing).
- Collect suggestions and improvements coming from the Customer's feedback and requirements and thus help us to provide new products and better solutions.
- Being tech-savvy and a lifelong learner, stay updated on new technologies and trends.
 
## Who you are

We would like someone who is excited by the opportunity to work in a rapidly evolving startup.
A perfect candidate needs to master most of the following subjects:

- Developer with a strong knowledge up to 2 languages (we love _Go_ but used to develop in _Python_ and _Rust_ and _C_, too)
- Distributed Systems best practices and patterns (_Pub/Sub_, _Actor Model_, _DDD_, _12 Factor_)
- DevOps culture, principles, and tools
- Application life-cycle management and delivery on top of _Kubernetes_ ecosystem (_vanilla_, _OCP_, _Rancher_)
- Container runtimes (_CRI-O_, _containerd_, _Docker_)
- Unix-like OS and basic shell scripting (_bash_, _shell_, _zsh_)
- Awareness of Configuration Management principles and tools (_Ansible_, _Puppet_, _Chef_), versus _Immutable Infrastructure_ one (_Packer_)
- Major Public Cloud services (_AWS_, _GCP_, _Azure_)
- GitOps practices (_GitLab_)
 
At **CLASTIX**, we understand that no one fits all, so we're open to supporting you if you are available to learn.
The following competencies would be considered a highly valuable plus:
 
- Profiling and Monitoring tools
- Software-Defined Networking and Storage solutions
- Virtualization
- Best practices and IT operations in High-Availability, Backup, and Disaster Recovery environments
- eBPF/XDP/TC
 
We require you'll be able to work in a multidisciplinary and cross-functional team with a proactive mindset: no time constraints, we just value the results.

Although our first language in the team is **English**, good and written spoken proficiency in **Italian** is a must.
 
## Our offer

We offer a full-time job and multiple benefits: continuous internal training, a performance-based bonus, a cool laptop (Lenovo X1), and remote working.

Gross salary is expected between **40K-60K EUR/year**, depending on the candidate's experience.
 
## Work location

Our offices are based in **Milan**, Italy, and **The Hague**, Netherlands.

However, we will also evaluate candidates living everywhere in **Europe** who want to **work from remote** and are open to travel only when required, such as company retreats or extraordinary meetings.
 
# Recruiting process

You'll get a first screening interview to discuss your background, your habits, and your previous working experience, also in the open-source community.

Once done, a small practical task will be assigned to you: a GitHub repository with the user story is going to be privately shared and a Pull Request is expected within the agreed deadline.

At this phase, a code review will be performed to evaluate your soft skills: we strongly believe in the remote-first approach, so an asynchronous mode of interactions is mandatory, as well as our core and ethical values.

If the Pull Request will be approved, a final call will be made and all the onboarding arrangements will be settled.
 
# How to apply

Sending an email with your CV attached to `jobs [at] clastix.io`.
 
Please share your GitHub/BitBucket/GitLab profile with us, if you have one and you are contributing to open-source projects.
